# dotfiles
After a long hiatus, I returned to Linux (Arch being my distro of choice). I switched to a "dry", minimalist setup with i3 and terminal apps. I've ditched mouse almost entirely and re-aquired some skills. I'm learning how to really use ViM (technically, I've known how to use Vim for some time, but I'm not terribly proficient with it). I'm slowly growing into it all and I absolutely 'LOVE' the experience! I've spent some time fiddling with different things and tweaking this and that. These are my dotfiles.

# Xresources
These settings are for the urxvt terminal (which I now perefer to both Termite and ST). I'm using the vanilla version of Inconsolata font, while the other two fonts provide additional glyphs.

# ViM
I'm not much of a ViM expert (yet :D), so my settings aren't super advanced, to say the least. For starters, I came up with a nice setup that's a combination of my own research and, of course, little bits and and pieeces I've borrowed from other people.

If you wanna try these out, you're going to need the Vundle plugin and you're also going to have to fiddle with YCM.

I also made a mod of one of the official Airline themes (minimalist.vim).

# i3
Nothing fancy here. Simple and functional (a few dedicated shortcuts for switching the keyboard layout and some minor visaula tweaks); suits my needs just fine.
