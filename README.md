# dotfiles
After a long hiatus i returned to Arch Linux. I've spent some time fiddling with different things and tweaking this and that. These are my dotfiles.

# Xresources
These settings are for the urxvt terminal (which I now perefer to both Termite and ST). I'm using the vanilla version of Inconsolata font while the other two fonts provide additional glyphs.

# ViM
I'm not much of a ViM expert (yet :D), but i'm slowly growing into it and I 'love' the experience! For starters, I came up with a nice setup that's a combination of my own research and, of course, little bits and and pieeces I've borrowed from other people.

If you wanna try these out, you're going to need the Vundle plugin and you're going to have to fiddle with YCM.
I also made a mod of one of the official Airline themes (minimalist.vim).

# i3
Nothing fancy here. Simple and functional; suits my needs just fine.
